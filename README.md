# Bisection-and-Newton-Method
The root of the function x^4+8x^2âˆ’9 has been found using both Bisection Method
and Newton Method

#The Bisection Method
The Bisection Method code starts by defining the function to be used,
describing the interval,
decribing the tolerance and maximum iterations.
The code then implements bisection method. 

#The Newton Method
The Newton Method starts by 
defining the function and its derivative, 
describing the initial guess, 
describing tolerance, maximum iteration and the iteration counter. 
It then implements the Newton Method using the Newton Rasphon equation
